What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize a repository, a hidden directory called ".git" is created.
  This directory is needed to track the history of the repository and stores details
  of all commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is intermediate between the working directory and repository.
  It allows the user the flexibility of adding only some files in a commit rather
  than having to commit all the files in the working directory. It hence enables
  more logical commits.
